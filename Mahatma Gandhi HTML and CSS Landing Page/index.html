    <br>
    ☛ Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, Gandhi's life was dedicated to challenging injustice through peaceful means.
    <br>
    <br>

    
    ☛ His philosophy of Satyagraha, or truth-force, inspired millions to stand against oppression with courage and integrity.<br>
    <br>
    
    ☛ Through acts of peaceful protest, fasting, and self-sacrifice, Gandhi led India to independence from British rule in 1947, leaving a legacy that continues to resonate globally as a beacon of hope for those seeking social change through nonviolence.</p></div>
